# # Lesson 1: Assignments | Modules

# 1. Python Modules and Data Handling Assignment
# Objective:
# The aim of this assignment is to assess your understanding and ability to implement Python modules, both built-in and custom, 
# and to apply data handling techniques using Python's data structures and error handling. This assignment will help solidify 
# your grasp on creating and using modules, as well as manipulating and processing data effectively in Python.

# Task 1: Your Mood Today

# Problem Statement: Create a Python program using a custom module that asks the user how they are feeling today and responds 
# with a custom message based on the mood entered.

# Code Example:

# ```python
# # mood_responses.py
# def mood_response(mood):
# # Implement your response logic here
# # main.py
# import mood_responses
# mood = input("How are you feeling today? ")
# print(mood_responses.mood_response(mood))

# ```
# Expected Outcome: The program should be able to take a user's mood as input (e.g., happy, sad, excited) and return a corresponding custom message.

import mood_responses

mood = input("\nHow are you feeling today? \n")
print(mood_responses.mood_response(f"\nThat's how I feel today: {mood}\n"))


# 2. Mastering Python Modules and Aliases

# Objective: The aim of this assignment is to enhance your proficiency in using Python modules, both standard and custom, with a specific 
# focus on importing with aliases. This will develop your skills in organizing code, simplifying access to module components, and 
# effectively managing namespace in Python programs.

# Task 1: Custom Module with Aliases

# Problem Statement: Create a custom module named text_utils.py with functions for string manipulation (e.g., reversing a string, capitalizing). 
# In your main script, import this module using an alias and utilize its functions.

# Code Example:
# ```python
# # text_utils.py
# def reverse_string(s):
# # function to reverse a string
# def capitalize_string(s):
#     # function to capitalize a string

# # main.py
# # Import text_utils using an alias and utilize its functions

# ```
# Expected Outcome: Your main script should be able to use the functions from text_utils.py via an alias, demonstrating an understanding of 
# custom module creation and aliasing.


import text_utils as tu

s = input("What's on your mind?\n")
print(tu.capitalize_string(s))
print(tu.replace_string(s))
print(tu.reverse_string(s))
